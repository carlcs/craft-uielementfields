# UI Element fields for Craft CMS

The plugin comes with the following field types, which look just like their UI Element counterparts.

- UI Tip
- UI Warning
- UI Template

## Installation

UI Element fields is available in the Plugin Store. You can also install the plugin manually from the command line with the following commands.
